<h1>Password Generator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
To protect online accounts from potential hacking attempts, I will create a program that generates stronger passwords. A key requirement of the program is the ability to customize password generation based on user input. In particular, I seek to determine how many uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers the user prefers in their passwords.
<br /><br />
By using a randomized approach, the program creates unique and robust passwords while adhering to user-specified criteria. Passwords must meet security standards, including a minimum length and a variety of characters.
<br /><br />
The output of the program is a randomly generated strong password, which users can use to fortify the security of their accounts.
<br /><br /> 
This endeavor is motivated by the desire to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to enhance their online security. A strong password is essential for protecting data and personal information in today's digital age, where cyber threats are prevalent.
<br /><br />
The primary data source for the program is user inputs collected interactively during execution. This allows the program to satisfy each user's requirements.
<br /><br />
In conclusion, the password strengthener program equips users with the means to fortify their accounts. This makes them less susceptible to cyber-attacks and ensures greater peace of mind in their online interactions.
